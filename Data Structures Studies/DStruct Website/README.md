# DStruct Website

This is a webside developed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Its purpose is to demonstrate the usage and real time implementation of mostly used data structures using JS.

This is an ongoing work until I learn how to implement all these data structures :)

## Structures included

1. Arrays
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Deques
5. Linked lists
6. Dictionaries
7. Hashes
8. Trees
9. Graphs
